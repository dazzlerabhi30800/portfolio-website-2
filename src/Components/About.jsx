        It’ s been a year and a half since I have started learning Web
        Development and decided to chose Frontend Development as a career
        option. In my Learning Curve I faced many ups and downs but that only
        made me better in this field, one things is for sure I love writing
        frontend code and other aspects of designing, making a smooth and
        interactive websites that really stands out in terms of experience and
        responsiveness. In my learning period of 2 yrs the most important thing
        that I learned is just don’t make it work, make it right.
